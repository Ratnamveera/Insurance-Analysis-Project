# Insurance-Analysis-Project
Insurance is a contract, represented by a policy, in which a policyholder receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company. This Analysis provides key insights into the performance of insurance-related activities, particularly in cross-sell, renewals, and new policies. It highlights performance metrics for account executives and tracks revenue opportunities. The insurance branch has strong performance in renewals, exceeding its target significantly. However, the new business generation is struggling and needs improvement. Cross-sell performance is moderate, with room to increase invoiced achievement. Account executives like Gilbert and Abhinav are leading in performance, indicating strong engagement efforts.
